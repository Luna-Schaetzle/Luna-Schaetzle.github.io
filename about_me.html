          I currently live in Kufstein & Innsbruck in Austria. I have two living
          places because my boyfriend lives in Innsbruck but my family lives in
          Kufstein. So I live in both places. I like these kinds of small towns,
          but Innsbruck is bigger so more things to do there. On the other Hand
          in Kufstein there is a lot of beautiful nature and is great for hiking and chilling.
          You can find my favorite places <a href="lists.html">here</a>. 
          Some pictures of my favorite places you can find in my <a href="random_img.html">Gallery</a>.

      <h3>My legend</h3>
      <p>
        I was Born in Freiburg im Breisgau in Germany. I lived there for 2 years. 
        Then my famaly moved to Austria. As a child I went to the Kindergarten in WÃ¶rgl.
        The Kindergarten I went was a very nice one. We spend a lot of the time out in the Nature.
        If we weren't outsite we had a big room with a lot of big soft building blocks where we build 
        houses and castels. After this time in the Kindergarten I went to the Volksschule in WÃ¶rgl.
        At the time of the Volksschule I started playing the guitar. To be honest I wasen't very good at it.
        Maby becouse I havend practiced enough. After the Volksschule I went to the New Middle School 2 in WÃ¶rgl.
        There where two Middle Schools in WÃ¶rgl. I was in the "IT" Middle School.

          <p>
            I love reading fantasy and Sci-Fi books and getting lost in other worlds
            (asspecially when the worldbuilding is good and complex). I always
            appreciate a good book recommendation :D.

          <h3>Trying things with AI</h3>
          <p>
            I try out som thing with AI like trying out some AI models I find on Hugging Face or trying to make my own AI model.
            Sometimes I combine it with Python and try to make a program that uses AI. Newly I tryed out Udio a Musik AI.
            You can find the songs I made with Udio <a href="songs.html">here</a>.
