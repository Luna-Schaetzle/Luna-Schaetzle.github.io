            Some of my favorite music artists ðŸŽ¶

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Madness</h3>
            <p>
              Madness is one of my favorite bands. They are a British band, funny how many of the good bands are from the UK, like Queens and The Beatles. 
              One of their songs is "Our House" which is my favorite song. But they have many other songs which are great too. They have a mix of ska, Punk and pop music.
              One of my favorite German comedian and show host Oliver Kalkofe is a big fan of them too.

            <h3>Supertramp</h3>
            <p>
              Supertramp is also a British band. I like their songs and their different style of music. They have one of my favorite Vinyl cover from the album "Breakfast in America". 
              On this cover you can see the skyline of New York but instead of the buildings you see a breakfast table staked so it looks like the buildings.

            <h3>Ginger Root</h3>
            <p>
              A very recent discovery of mine. I found them on YouTube while I was scrolling through my recommendations. I absolutely love their music videos on YouTube because they 
              not only creative but mimic the style of the 80s which I love. They also mimic the style of the 80s song which I appreciate.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Will Wood</h3>
            <p>
              Will Wook is a very special artist if you look for thier songs wich are often more on the psychedelic side.
              Thier song topics are often very interesting and the different style of music hooked me up.
              My favorite song of them is "I / Me / Myself" which coveres the topic of the strugle of genderroles and gender identity in society, and also the norms put on us by society.
              In thier songs they often talk about mental health and the struggles of life. Which helps me a lot in bad times :D. When I can listen to thier songs and feel not alone with my struggles.

            <h3>Neon Genesis Evangelion</h3>
            <p>
              Neon Genesis Evangelion has a very special place in my heart. Some may say that it looks old or they don't get the story but thats exactly what I love so much about it.
              I love the deep dive into the psychology of the characters and thier backstory. And the great ending of the Series wich is very different what you can find elswere.
              It realy had an impact on my life and how I see myself and how I see other people. I really love the deep lore with the many mysteries which are left unanswered even afert 
              they made three different endings to the storyline. You might ask three different endings? Yes, they did three but thats a hole othere story, that I might eleborate further 
              in one or more block posts in the future. Maby also with a Video if I try out YouTube some day. I could talk all day long about NGE but I will stop here :D.
